/**
 * class Animation
 *
 * The Animation class handles the logic of advancing frames based on the animation type
 * and returning a renderable frame.
 *
 * The intention with the class is to keep it as flexible as possible so that the animations
 * can be used not only for character animations but any animated in-game objects.
