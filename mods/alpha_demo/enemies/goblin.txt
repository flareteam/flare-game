# The item_class is a list of strings, which describe which kind of loot
# is being dropped. The strings should match the "class" entry in the item
# database. Optionally a number can be passed after each string entry to
# adapt the probablity of the entry. If the optional probability number
# is omited, 1 is assumed.

# The following configuration has a sum of all weights of 1+9=10, so
# the distribution is steps of 10 percents.
# Currency will be dropped in 10 percent of the cases. In 90 percent there
# will be items, which belong to the goblindrop class.
