him=I am Guill, a scribe with the Order. I am grateful you've come -- we are short on trained warriors due to the call-to-arms in Ancelot.
you=Why is the Order interested in these ruins?
him=What the locals call the Goblin Warrens is actually the entrance to a grand underground fortress known as Averguard Keep. This site is sacred to our order. Our primary mission is to cleanse the evil from this place.

him=The goblins in the Warrens answer to a warlord named Ukkonen. Most goblins are merely curious; this Ukkonen is bloodthirsty. Punish him for desecrating this place. His lair is here in the Warrens.

him=This tome confirms what we know of Averguard Keep -- it crumbled against the plague many centuries ago. But not all of the infected were destroyed. It appears many undead where locked away in hopes that a cure would be found.
you=Why were the undead spared?
him=I don't know, but we should investigate. Head into the Atrium, then the Averguard Prison. Search for a key to access the sealed areas of the Keep.

him=There is one place within the Keep that no living being has seen for centuries: the burial chamber behind Averguard Temple. From the Atrium you can access the Temple. Use your key to enter the Burial Chamber.
you=Who is buried there?
him=The powerful leader of the Averguard -- Sir Evan Maddox.

#You insert the Averguard Key. Runes glow around the door, then fade. The door is still sealed.

you=I tried the key on the Burial Chamber door but it would not open.
him=It must be sealed by powerful magic. There was only one sorceror of Averguard with that kind of power - Professor Langlier. Search through his collection to find a way into the Burial Chamber. Enter the Academy through the Atrium.
you=As you wish.
him=I must admit jealousy -- I have dreamed many years of seeing the old volumes there, but it is simply too dangerous yet.

him=My worst fear is come alive. Just as with the Warden and with Professor Langlier, Sir Evan Maddox himself was inflicted with undeath. If we are to reclaim the Keep, you must defeat him. The Order will reward you magnificently for this service. But be prepared -- not even undeath will limit Maddox's zeal. Enter the Burial Chamber and allow him redemption.
