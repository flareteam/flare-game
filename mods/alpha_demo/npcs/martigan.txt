you=I heard you might have something more interesting.
him=Ah, you're the adventurer? If you seek out danger you're in the right place. We had two guards stationed here; both were recalled to Ancelot. Now we're vulnerable.
you=So how's the mining business?
him=Not good at all. While I was digging, my pickaxe scraped a skull that was wedged in the rock wall. Before I knew it, the nasty thing started moving and a whole body emerged. Now that thing is in there, preventing any more mining.
him=Kill that skeleton for me, and I'll make it worth your while.
