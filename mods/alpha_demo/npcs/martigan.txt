him=Welcome to my mines, stranger. If you have the back for it, I've got the work.
you=I heard you might have something more interesting.
him=Ah, you're the adventurer? If you seek out danger you're in the right place. We had two guards stationed here; both were recalled to Ancelot. Now we're vulnerable.

him=These are rough lands and... you're looking for an adventure!
him=Let me know out if the goblins found the way inside the abandoned tower.

him=Are you sure?
you=What do you mean? Of course I am!
him=Did you look inside the tower? Did you make sure there aren't goblins in there?
you=Well...

you=So how's the mining business?
him=Not good at all. While I was digging, my pickaxe scraped a skull that was wedged in the rock wall. Before I knew it, the nasty thing started moving and a whole body emerged. Now that thing is in there, preventing any more mining.
him=Kill that skeleton for me, and I'll make it worth your while.
