msgid "Guill, Scribe of the Order"
msgstr ""

msgid "I am Guill, a scribe with the Order. I am grateful you've come -- we are short on trained warriors due to the call-to-arms in Ancelot."
msgstr ""

msgid "Why is the Order interested in these ruins?"
msgstr ""

msgid "What the locals call the Goblin Warrens is actually the entrance to a grand underground fortress known as Averguard Keep. This site is sacred to our order. Our primary mission is to cleanse the evil from this place."
msgstr ""

msgid "The goblins in the Warrens answer to a warlord named Ukkonen. Most goblins are merely curious; this Ukkonen is bloodthirsty. Punish him for desecrating this place. His lair is here in the Warrens."
msgstr ""

msgid "The Averguard left a set of Chronicles detailing their final era. One volume is missing. I've searched this entire area except for Ukkonen's lair. If you find the book please return to me."
msgstr ""

msgid "I'll keep an eye out for it."
msgstr ""

msgid "You found this tome in Ukkonen's lair? Most excellent -- I feared this volume was lost. With it we can piece together the true history of this keep. I just need a moment to study..."
msgstr ""

msgid "This tome confirms what we know of Averguard Keep -- it crumbled against the plague many centuries ago. But not all of the infected were destroyed. It appears many undead where locked away in hopes that a cure would be found."
msgstr ""

msgid "Why were the undead spared?"
msgstr ""

msgid "I don't know, but we should investigate. Head into the Atrium, then the Averguard Prison. Search for a key to access the sealed areas of the Keep."
msgstr ""

msgid "I have the prison key. The old prison warden carried it on his person -- he was infected, haunting the depths of the Prison."
msgstr ""

msgid "A true shame that he was infected.  Well, now that we have the Averguard Key, the depths of Averguard Keep are open to us. The Order thanks you."
msgstr ""

msgid "There is one place within the Keep that no living being has seen for centuries: the burial chamber behind Averguard Temple. From the Atrium you can access the Temple. Use your key to enter the Burial Chamber."
msgstr ""

msgid "Who is buried there?"
msgstr ""

msgid "The powerful leader of the Averguard -- Sir Evan Maddox."
msgstr ""

msgid "I tried the key on the Burial Chamber door but it would not open."
msgstr ""

msgid "It must be sealed by powerful magic. There was only one sorceror of Averguard with that kind of power - Professor Langlier. Search through his collection to find a way into the Burial Chamber. Enter the Academy through the Atrium."
msgstr ""

msgid "As you wish."
msgstr ""

msgid "I must admit jealousy -- I have dreamed many years of seeing the old volumes there, but it is simply too dangerous yet."
msgstr ""

msgid "I am back from the Academy. Langlier was rags and bones, yet still a powerful mage. He wore this symbol."
msgstr ""

msgid "Fate has delivered this talisman to you. With it and the Averguard Key, you have the ability to open the Burial Chamber. Read these runes aloud at the sealed door and the path will be opened."
msgstr ""

msgid "My worst fear is come alive. Just as with the Warden and with Professor Langlier, Sir Evan Maddox himself was inflicted with undeath. If we are to reclaim the Keep, you must defeat him. The Order will reward you magnificently for this service. But be prepared -- not even undeath will limit Maddox's zeal. Enter the Burial Chamber and allow him redemption."
msgstr ""

msgid "You have risked much for the Order. Take this final reward, as your mission here is complete. The grip of necromancy over Averguard Keep is broken -- in time the remaining undead will pass over into death."
msgstr ""

msgid "Thank you Guill. I am glad to be of service."
msgstr ""

msgid "It is still dangerous here, but with Maddox defeated his followers will soon find rest."
msgstr ""

msgid "Ukkonen is defeated -- I sensed a calm in this place the moment you ended him. Take this reward for your bravery."
