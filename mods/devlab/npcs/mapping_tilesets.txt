him=Now let's talk about tilesets. A tileset is an image containing all the tiles you see in the game.
you=But there are so many different places, like dungeons or the outside world. That would be a very large image?
him=Every map in flare only has one style. Each style is in one tileset. In Tiled you may see multiple tilesets per map however.
