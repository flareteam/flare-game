him=So did you open this map?
you=Not yet, I got lost in the folder structure.
him=There is the folder tiled in the repository, which contains files ending in *.tmx. That's the maps you're looking for. This map should be found at devlab/lab_mapping.tmx
you=Ok found it. Can I just edit the file and save to get my changes in the game?
him=No, the tmx format is powerful and complicated, in the flare engine we're rather using a simplified format ending in *.txt. So you need to export the map to a Flare map.
you=The export dialog is asking for a file location. This map should be exported to mods/devlab/maps/lab_mapping.txt
him=You're learning pretty fast. Now continue to the next room, where we'll talk about tilesets.
