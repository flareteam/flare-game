him=You there! I need your help. I'm the last of my group, and want nothing more than to leave this place.
him=Yet I have one remaining task. I wish to visit the graves of my three fallen partners one last time.
him=To my disadvantage, their bodies have been taken by the soil here. They tried to attack me when I got near.
him=If you can prove to me that they are free from their cursed form, I will be in your debt.
him=I can't assist you myself, but I can offer some of my wares.
