# Flare
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Flare (Free Libre Action Roleplaying Engine) is a simple game engine built to handle a very specific kind of game: single-player 2D action RPGs. Flare is not a reimplementation of an existing game or engine. It is a tribute to and exploration of the action RPG genre.

Rather than building a very abstract, robust game engine, the goal of this project is to build several real games and harvest an engine from the common, reusable code. The first game, in progress, is a fantasy dungeon crawl.

Flare uses simple file formats (INI style config files) for most of the game data, allowing anyone to easily modify game contents. Open formats are preferred (png, ogg). The game code is C++.

## Running Flare

If the program is installing system-wide (i.e., you typed 'make install' and it worked), you can run it just by executing the 'flare' command.

If you did not perform the installation step, you should find the binary in in the top directory, and run it from there, like this:

    ./flare

Also, in newer versions, the game can be launched from an icon in your main menu in your GUI environment (KDE, GNOME, etc.).

If you're running flare from your operating system's gui file browser (e.g. Windows Explorer or OSX Finder), you'll want to use one of the provided launchers.  This helps the flare executable use its own working directory, so it can see all those data folders.



## Settings

Settings are stored in one of these places:

    $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/flare
    $HOME/.config/flare
    ./config

Here you can enable fullscreen, change the game resolution, enable mouse-move, and change keybindings. The settings files are created the first time you run Flare.



## Save Files

Save files are stored in one of these places:

    $XDG_DATA_HOME/flare
    $HOME/.local/share/flare
    ./saves

If permissions are correct, the game is automatically saved when you exit.
