		<p>The player can choose between three different character classes with distinct strengths and skills. Each character class has unique powers to unlock and improve as they level up.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Brute - A close-quarters fighter who utilizes swords, throwing-knives and other bladed weapons.</li>
			<li>Scout - A ranged weapon and trap specialist who primarily uses bows to defeat its foes.</li>
			<li>Adept - A spell caster who challenges enemies with fire, ice and lightning-based attacks.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Players may find or buy different items to protect themselves from attacks or boost their stats. These include potions, scrolls, weapons, armor, and magical artifacts. Along with the normal equipment, there are enchanted, rare, and unique pieces of gear that provide extra bonuses.</p>
