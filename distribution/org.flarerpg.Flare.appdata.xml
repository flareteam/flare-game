	<summary>2D action role playing game</summary>
	<description>
		<p>Flare is an open source, 2D action role playing game. Its gameplay can be likened to the games in the Diablo series.</p>
		<p>The Empyrean Campaign is a game made by the Flare team. The story begins with the player being exiled from their homeland of Empyrean, resulting in them embarking on a quest to regain entry. This journey takes the player through many regions, with plenty of side quests along the way.</p>
		<p>The player can choose between three different character classes with distinct strengths and skills. Each character class has unique powers to unlock and improve as they level up.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Brute - A close-quarters fighter who utilizes swords, throwing-knives and other bladed weapons.</li>
			<li>Scout - A ranged weapon and trap specialist who primarily uses bows to defeat its foes.</li>
			<li>Adept - A spell caster who challenges enemies with fire, ice and lightning-based attacks.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Players may find or buy different items to protect themselves from attacks or boost their stats. These include potions, scrolls, weapons, armor, and magical artifacts. Along with the normal equipment, there are enchanted, rare, and unique pieces of gear that provide extra bonuses.</p>
		<p>The Flare engine is licensed under GPL 3, whereas the Empyrean Campaign is licensed under CC-BY-SA 3.0. Both the engine and the game content are being actively developed, including new features, art, and content.</p>
